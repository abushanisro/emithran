/**
 * Anthropic tool schemas Echo exposes to Claude.
 *
 * Each schema is the JSON contract for a read-only backend tool that wraps an
 * existing NestJS service. The actual handler lives in `tool-dispatcher.ts`.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - All `*Id` fields are UUIDs.
 *   - Descriptions are written for the LLM. They MUST tell Claude when (and
 *     when NOT) to use the tool — that's how we control quality.
 *   - Inputs are minimal. Hydrated entity context is already in the user turn,
 *     so we don't ask Claude to repeat ids it can see.
