Manufacturing Feature Extractors — family-specific geometry analysis using OpenCASCADE.

Each extractor converts raw OCC topology into manufacturing-relevant features:
  - SheetMetalFeatureExtractor: thickness, cut length, bends, holes, slots
  - (Future) MachiningFeatureExtractor, TurningFeatureExtractor

Separation of concerns:
  Python CAD engine  = geometry intelligence (this file)
  Node.js planner    = manufacturing intelligence (routing, costing)

NOTE: bend and slot detection thresholds are V1 heuristics. Validate against
20+ real parts and tune before treating results as production-grade.

      reasons   — human-readable list explaining which signals fired

    secondary_features_count: cross holes (non-axial cylinders) + pocket count.
      > 0 elevates cnc_turned → mill_turn.

    cyl_axis_alignment: fraction of cyl faces sharing the dominant axis (0–1).
      > 0.60 → rotationally symmetric (turned part regardless of elongation).

    rotational_face_ratio: cylindrical face count / total face count (0–1).
      > 0.30 → most surfaces are cylindrical → confirms turned, not milled housing.
      Guards against mis-classifying round milled housings / pipe manifolds.

    planar_face_fraction: planar face count / total face count (0–1).
      > 0.70 → mostly planar surfaces → sheet metal or simple block.

    total_face_count: total OCC face count used to compute hole density.

    large_cyl_count: number of cylindrical faces with radius > 15% of max bbox dimension.
      These represent external OD surfaces (turned diameters, large bores) — not sheet holes.
      > 3 → hard veto on sheet_metal gates (a genuine sheet metal part has only small holes).

    pocket_count: number of prismatic pocket floor faces detected.
      > 2 → hard veto on sheet_metal gates (pockets require milling, not laser/punch).
      Also doubles as an injection-molded proxy below: ribs and bosses read as pocket-detector
      floor faces (the same false-positive mechanism already documented for milled blocks),
      so an elevated pocket_count on an otherwise non-flat, non-rotational part is as much
      evidence of "shell + ribs + bosses" as it is of "milled block with pockets".

    thin_wall_ratio: fraction of antiparallel planar face-pairs (see
      _extract_sheet_metal_geometry) that fall in a plausible thin-wall band but are spread
      across MULTIPLE close bins rather than one dominant modal bin (0–1). Sheet metal
      produces one sharp, overwhelming bin (one gauge everywhere); a molded shell + ribs +
      bosses produces several close-but-distinct thin bins (nominal wall, rib walls, boss
      walls — all thin, none identical). High thin_wall_ratio with no single dominant bin is
      evidence for injection_molded, not sheet_metal.

    draft_face_ratio: fraction of "vertical" walls (relative to the shortest bbox axis, the
      likely mold pull direction) sitting at a small non-zero angle (roughly 0.3°–5°) off
      that axis, rather than exactly parallel/perpendicular to it (0–1). Sheet metal and
      milled walls are (within tolerance) exactly parallel or perpendicular; molded parts are
      deliberately drafted for ejection. 0.0 when not computed (caller doesn't support it yet).

        Topology-based extraction of (thickness_mm, dominant_face, confidence, debug).

        Algorithm:
          1. Walk all planar faces once.
             Collect (face, unit_normal, plane_d, area, centroid) where
             plane_d = dot(unit_normal, plane_location_point).

          2. Find every antiparallel pair (dot(n_i, n_j) < -0.92) whose
             perpendicular distance falls in [0.3 mm, 20% of max_bbox_dim].
             Distance formula for an antiparallel pair:
               dist = |d_i + d_j|
             This is exact because n_j ≈ -n_i, so
               dot(n_i, loc_j) = -d_j  →  separation = |d_i - (-d_j)| = |d_i + d_j|
             Works for ANY normal orientation, not just ±X/Y/Z.

          3. Area-weighted distance histogram at 0.05 mm resolution.
             Each pair votes with weight = combined_area of both faces.
             Modal bin = sheet material gauge.
             (A 55-bend frame with many flat sections all at 2 mm produces a
              clear majority vote over the rare large-distance pairs.)

          4. Among pairs within ±15% of the modal thickness, score each pair:
               score = combined_area × (1 + 0.3 × centrality)
             where centrality = 1 − (dist_from_part_centre / bbox_half_diag).
             Highest score → dominant blank face.

          5. Confidence = f(area_ratio of modal bin, plausibility vs bbox).

        only see cylindrical bend-radius faces; a sharp-corner model has none of

        Detects large planar face pairs that:
          - share a common straight (non-arc) edge — a fold line, not a hole/fillet
            boundary,
          - are NOT coplanar: dihedral angle between unit normals in (15°, 165°).
            Below 15° is a coplanar split face (not a bend); above 165° is a
            hem/fold-flat — geometrically degenerate for this proxy, excluded to
            avoid double-counting a hem as an extra bend line,
          - both faces are large flange panels, not the laser-cut perimeter wall.
            That wall meets the top/bottom panel at ~90° too, but it is only

        Each qualifying pair counts as one bend line (a topology proxy for one

        one bend per radius pair).

    Phase 2 (im_v2_phase2): adds three new measurement passes:
      _analyze_wall_uniformity  — std-dev / thin-wall violations, derived from
        the existing antiparallel-face-pair histogram at zero extra OCC cost.
      _analyze_draft_angles     — per-wall-face draft angle vs the pull axis
        (shortest bbox dimension); yields undrafted_face_count, undercut_face_count,
        and parting_complexity (0-1) consumed by the routing engine.
      _detect_blind_features    — cylinder adjacency check (cap face detection)
        that splits hole_or_boss_count into through_hole_count + blind_feature_count;
        first step toward boss vs blind-hole discrimination (Phase 3).

        Measure per-face draft angles on "wall faces" — planar faces whose normal

        Pull direction = the canonical axis (x/y/z) aligned with the shortest
        bounding-box dimension (the standard mold opening / ejection direction).

        For a wall face with unit normal n and pull unit vector p:

          drafted:     0.3° ≤ angle ≤ 5°    — within standard draft range

          complexity ≥ 0.5 → deflashing routed (stepped/complex shutoff line).

        Confidence is 0.65 — a V1 heuristic on a single-body assumption. Molds with

        _analyze_draft_angles — zero additional OCC passes.

        Rib geometry signature: two parallel planar faces (antiparallel normals,
        |dot(n1, n2)| > 0.97) facing each other, separated by a rib-thickness
        distance in the rib range [rib_min, rib_max].

        sink marks on the opposite surface. Upper limit 0.85× wall to avoid
        misclassifying structural wall sections as ribs.

        Offset sign convention for antiparallel pairs:
